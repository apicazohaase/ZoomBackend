# ZoomBackend #
Backend of the Zoom application programmed in JavaScript language. 
For the development of this backend it has been used the Blockchain Hyperledger software hosted by The Linux Foundation. This technology allows to leverage the embedded logic in smart contracts to automate business processes across your network. It also establishes trust, transparency and accountability as well as confidential transactions.
The content of the backend will be updated while it is being developed.
